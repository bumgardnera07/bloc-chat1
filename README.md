The project uses Node to run a JS server in development. This will be important when we want to use urls /album or /collection instead of the basic album.html or collection.html. It may  help to review [our resource on NPM and `package.json` files](https://www.bloc.io/resources/npm-and-package-json).

Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application server:

```
$ npm start
```

The server will start up. To stop the server, press `cntrl + c`.


## Use in Brackets Live Preview

To use the application with the Live Preview functionality of the Brackets text editor, go to __File > Project Settings__ and add `http://localhost:3000` to the Base URL field.

The text in the application will not update on every keystroke, but changes will automatically push when you save the file.

### Assets/Images

Add images to the `app/assets/images` directory. To reference images in HTML, use the path `/assets/images/<image file name>.jpg`. For example, to include the image called `bloc-white-logo.png`, the path for the `src` attribute in the HTML would be:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/bloc-white-logo.png">
```

__Note:__ A sample image has been added to `app/images`. To remove the image from the application, run the following command from the root of repo:

```bash
$ rm -f app/assets/images/bloc-white-logo.png
```

To reference any other assets, like the music in Bloc Jams, use the path `assets/<asset-type>/<asset-file-name>`.

### Difference between Pages and Templates

The `templates` directory should hold any HTML files used as templates in Angular states configured by UI Router. All other HTML files belong in the `pages` directory.
